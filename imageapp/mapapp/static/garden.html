                A nursery garden is a dedicated space for growing young plants, trees, and shrubs, typically for sale
                 or future planting. It serves as a nurturing environment where seedlings and saplings are carefully 
                 tended to until they are strong enough to be transplanted into larger gardens or landscapes. 
                 Nursery gardens often feature a wide variety of plants, including flowers, vegetables, fruit trees, 
                 and ornamental shrubs, offering gardeners a diverse selection. These gardens provide essential care, 
                 such as watering, pruning, and pest management, ensuring that the plants thrive before reaching their 
                 final destination.
